# React Router tips &tracks

This project is a React application that utilizes the `react-router-dom` library for client-side routing. It includes various pages, layouts, and components to create a multi-page web application. The project also demonstrates the usage of protected routes, error handling, and a custom 404 page.

## Usage

This project serves as a template for building React applications with client-side routing. Customize the pages, layouts, and components based on your project requirements.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `pages/`: Individual page components.
  - `pages/learn/`: Pages related to learning content.
  - `App.js`: Main application component containing the routing configuration.
  - ...

## Components

### `ErrorHandler`

The `ErrorHandler` component displays an error message with a status code, title, and provides options to refresh the page or return to the home page.

### `PageNotFound`

The `PageNotFound` component is a custom 404 page that is displayed when a route is not found. It includes a message and a link to return to the home page.

### `ProtectedRoute`

The `ProtectedRoute` component is a wrapper around the `Route` component, allowing conditional rendering based on whether a user is authenticated. If the user is not allowed, it redirects to a specified path.

## Routing

The application uses the `react-router-dom` library for routing. Routes are configured in the `App.js` file using the `createRoutesFromElements` function. The main layout is defined in `RootLayout`, and various pages are nested within it.

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented using the `ErrorHandler` component, which is rendered when an error occurs during navigation.

## Protected Routes

Protected routes are implemented using the `ProtectedRoute` component, which ensures that certain routes are only accessible when the user is authenticated.
